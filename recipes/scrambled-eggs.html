    <h1>Scrambled eggs</h1>
    <br>
    <ul><h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <li>Eggs: 2 per serving</li>
        <li>Butter: for flavour and greasing the skillet</li>
        <li>Milk: makes the eggs extra moist and creamy but it's not essential, scrambled eggs can still be creamy without. Use 1/2 tablespoon per egg</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <li>Whisk the eggs, milk, salt and pepper</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a non stick pan or well seasoned skillet over medium heat (or medium low if your stove is strong)</li>
        <li>Add egg mixture, wait 5 seconds (for the base to just start setting) then start leisurely (not frantically!) running a rubber spatula or flat edge wooden spoon in long strokes back and forth across the pan, and around the edges. This technique pushes the cooked egg off the base and piles them up (which creates those beautiful soft curds you see) and lets the raw egg spread out into the pan to cook</li>
        <li>After 30 seconds, also start gently folding the eggs over (ie scoop and gently flip). Keep pushing/folding for 60 seconds total cook time or until raw runny egg no longer spreads out onto the pan and you have a pile of soft, custardy egg, ever so slightly underdone</li>
        <li>Remove from the stove, stir / fold for another 10 seconds or until cooked to your taste. If you want it cooked more, return it to the stove briefly.</li>
